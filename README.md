Code challenge for Park Mobile. I Built this code challenge using the github api. I was suprised that most of the organizations did not have too much info when I made the get request. To improve the app I would of researched differnt api's that would contain more prudent information on the topic. I also did very minimal css, mainly just alined items center vertically and horizontally. Code is commented out and should give you a general thought process on when I was thinking when I built the app. Thank You for opportunity.
